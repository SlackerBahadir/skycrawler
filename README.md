# 🔭 skycrawler

**skycrawler** is a CLI tool that provides you with the celestial objects you can observe in a desired location, their probability of observability, weather conditions, and the best days to observe them.

> This tool is still under development. So you may not find much in the repo, including the README file.

## Why "skycrawler"?

The name **skycrawler** is inspired by the “web crawlers” used by search engines. Think of insects crawling in the sky and you will understand the name.
